                     <span>There are parts of the Bay Area that have a Latino Population that make up 94.1% and the average househould income is $60,257 and in this area only 9.9% of the populated area hold a Bachelor's Degree. There are parts in Los Angeles that have a Latino Population 83.3% and the average household income is $53,100. Based on statistic's pulled from levels.fyi the average salary for a Software Engineer in the Bay Area is $231,000 and the average Software Engineer is either White or Asian.

                     <h3>Latino Youth STEM Programs</h3>
                     <p>The problem we found is the inequality in education and jobs in tech for the latino youth community. A solution to that is getting the latino youth access to non-profit organizations that focus on giving back to the latino youth through STEM programs. There is a very large tech scene in the SF/Bay Area and in the Los Angeles area that our latino youth is missing out on. One of the main goals is to bridge the gap to tech for these students. Getting exposure to tech as a student is critical to the Latino youth. There are Non-Profit Organzations that are out there that want to help expose these children to the possiblities of what they can do. There is Digital Nest in Watsonville, CA and Salinas, CA and these two hubs provide free wireless and tutors to help students stay connected with internet to be able to study and turn in their homeowork. They also provide internships for these students and expose them to front end development. So far they've helped place 100+ students into jobs, internships, and schools since 2014. The average salary an alumni makes is $45,760 dollars per year. There's also a non-profit called Teens Exploring Tech in the Los Angeles area and they are there to provide kids from 7th to 11th grade from low income communities with developing strong teams and use coding as a catalyst to turn them into technology leaders who build positive communities. </p>

                     <p>We bring growth and stability to the rural, agricultural-based cities of Watsonville and Salinas. Our communities were historically locked out of the economic opportunity and digital innovation brought by the tech to other California communities. We knew that our kids deserve the very best to nurture their talents, wisdom, and passions so we built our own thriving center for technology and empowerment that prepares our young people to prosper in the workforce. Digital NEST spins a web of connection and opportunity across the entire community. Digital NEST CONNECTS youth to a skill-building community that TRANSFORMS them into professionals who can CREATE successful careers, innovative solutions, and prosperous communities. </p>

                     <p>Dev/Mission has been connecting more than 260 low-income young adults to careers in Tech through post-secondary STEM careers and jobs in the tech industry as well as exposing K-12 to STEAM Activities. Dev/Mission provides STEM opportunities for untapped 6-24 year-olds San Francisco Bay Area youth. Our goal is to connect underserved populations to careers in technology by teaching programming, hardware, and critical career skills. We are the best practice in technology training program that teaches untapped young adults ages 16-24, technology skills in hardware, coding and critical skills.

                        We will close that tech gap by connecting tech companies; their employees and participants to corporate site visits, a mentorship model and internship/apprenticeship opportunities.</p>

                     <h3>DIY Girls</h3>
                     <p>The problem starts early, Less than 15% of girls show an interest in STEAM at the critical ages between 4th-8th grades and only gets worse, currently, women represent just 28% of overall employed scientists and engineers in the United States, of which only 5% are represented by women of color. We do what we do in order to change the way girls perceive tech careers. We believe that creating with tech builds the confidence needed to make anything possible. We want DIY girls to apply the technical skills they learn to projects they love.</p>
